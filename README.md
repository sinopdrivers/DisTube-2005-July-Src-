# DisTube-2005-July-Src-

Okay, look, since DisTube was shut down on June 6, 2024, I leaked the source code. If anyone wants to create a better 2005 revival, you should use this. It's pretty accurate, right? If not, feel free to delete anything you don't like.

<br> To set up DisTube, you need to create a database, import notsports.sql, and then update the SQL details in the files.
